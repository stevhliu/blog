I am a technical writer at ðŸ¤— [Hugging Face](https://hf.co), working on writing and maintaining the developer documentation for open-source libraries like [Transformers](https://hf.co/docs/transformers/index) and [Diffusers](https://hf.co/docs/diffusers/index).

My focus is on making the documentation clear and accessible for *everyone* who is building, researching, or learning about AI.
