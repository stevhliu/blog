Chat models rely on *chat templates* to convert structured chat data into a single tokenizable string a model can process.

The chat template below is from [gpt-oss-20b](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b). When you send a message to ChatGPT, this is what it looks like on the backend.
  
<Snippet language="yaml">
{`<|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions
  You are a professional pitmaster.
  <|end|>
  <|start|>user<|message|>
  Give me a step-by-step recipe for smoking a 12 lb brisket.
  <|end|>
  <|start|>assistant
`}
</Snippet>

- `<|start|>` and `<|end|>` tokens indicate the start and end of a message
- conversational roles like `developer`, `user` and `assistant` are labeled
- `<|message|>` token indicates the message content

The template ensures a model knows who's speaking and maintains conversation order to make it feel natural and aligned.

Models may be trained with different chat templates that use different tokens. For example, [Llama 4](https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama4/#-llama-4---prompt-formats-) uses the `<|begin_of_text|>` token instead of `<|start|>`. This is important because if you use a chat template that doesn't match the one a model was trained with, you may end up with poor responses.
